## Note on Checkstyle

After you make changes to `Main.java`, you might notice that the build fails due to a checkstyle error. This is due to the `// TODO` comment; it will succeed when that comment is removed. You will probably see builds fail quite a bit more often during this course, as you push your own code. Keep an eye on this; it is often a helpful signal that something is broken or imperfect, so learning to read the logs to figure out why it failed is a helpful skill. Naturally, the build should not fail when you turn in your assignments.
